# Front-End Foundations

### Version control essentials

* Git basics: init, clone, commit, push, pull, branches.
* Using GitHub or other remote repo to back up and share your code.

### Basic JavaScript

* What JS is, how to include it in pages.
* DOM manipulation: select elements, change content/style, respond to events (clicks, form submits).
* Simple things: variables, functions, loops, conditionals.
* Modern JS (ES6+): let/const, arrow functions, modules. (Good enough for static sites where you might have some dynamic behavior.)

### Browser tools / Debugging

* Using browser dev tools (inspect element, console, network tab).
* Checking responsiveness, debugging JS errors.

### Accessibility, UX basics, SEO basics

* Make sure content is readable, use alt text for images, proper semantic HTML tags etc.
* Basic performance: minimize large images, efficient CSS.
* Meta tags, title tags, structuring markup so that search engines can parse it.

### Putting it together: build a static site

* Choose a simple project: e.g. personal portfolio, a small business page, blog-like page but static.
* Host it (GitHub Pages, Netlify, or cheap static hosting) so itâ€™s accessible online.
* Validate HTML/CSS; test on different devices/screen sizes.
