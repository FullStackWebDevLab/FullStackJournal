# HTML & CSS

### Browser rendering process

Understand how a browser parses HTML to build the DOM, and CSS to build the CSSOM, then combines them into the render tree. Learn about layout, painting, and compositing. Study the difference between reflow and repaint, and how render-blocking resources affect performance. Explore concepts like the critical rendering path, event loop, and JavaScript execution. Compare static content, client-side rendering, server-side rendering, and static site generation.

### Semantic HTML & page structure

Understand not just *how* to write HTML, but *which* tags to use for meaning: headings (`<h1>` - `<h6>`), paragraphs, sections, article, nav, header, footer, aside, main, etc. Learn how semantic markup improves accessibility, SEO, and maintainability.
Also include forms (input types, labels, `fieldset` / `legend`), images (with `alt` attributes), links, lists, and metadata (like `<head>` content, `meta` tags).

### HTML form structure, validation, and accessibility

Learn how to build well-structured forms: use `<form>`, `<label>` suitably, associate labels with inputs, group related fields with `<fieldset>` & `<legend>`. Understand form validation (HTML5 attributes: `required`, `type`, `min`, `pattern`, etc.). Make forms accessible (keyboard navigation, screen readers).

### CSS selectors, specificity, cascading

Know different kinds of selectors: element, class, id, attribute, pseudo-classes/pseudo-elements. Understand how specificity works, how conflicting rules are resolved. Know about cascading order, inheritance.

### Box model & layout fundamentals

Master how the box model works: content, padding, borders, margins. Understand display types (`block`, `inline`, `inline-block`, `none`, etc.). Learn positioning (static, relative, absolute, fixed, sticky). Practice with layout systems like Flexbox (for one-dimensional alignment) and CSS Grid (for two-dimensional grid layouts).

### Colors, typography, spacing, visuals

Learn CSS properties for fonts (font-family, font-size, line-height), color (hex, rgb, hsl, opacity), backgrounds, borders. Spacing: margin, padding. Visual styles: borders, shadows, hover/focus states. Also learn best practices (contrast, readability, consistent design).

### Responsive Web Design (RWD)

Understand how to make layouts adapt to different screen sizes and devices. Key skills: media queries, fluid or relative units (%, `vw`/`vh`, `rem`), responsive images (using `srcset`, `picture`), mobile-first design mindset. Learn about setting viewport meta tag properly.

### Best practices, maintainability & accessibility

Learn to keep HTML/CSS clean and maintainable: consistent indentation, modular structure (separate concerns), avoiding overly nested elements, avoiding over-use of non-semantic tags like `<div>` and `<span>` when semantic ones suffice. Enforce accessible practices: use `alt` for images, proper labels, keyboard focus states, ARIA only when needed. Also learn basics of SEO as they tie into HTML structure (proper headings, meta descriptions, titles).
