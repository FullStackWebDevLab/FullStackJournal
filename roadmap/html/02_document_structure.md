# Document Structure

## Essential Document Tags

**Tags covered:**

  + `<!DOCTYPE>`
  + `<html>`
  + `<head>`
  + `<body>`

+ Overall tree from `<!DOCTYPE>` → `<html>` → `<head>` → `<body>`.
+ Parent-child relationships and nesting rules.
+ Elements necessary for validity.

## Structural Requirements

+ Correct sequence of major sections.
+ Only one `<head>` and one `<body>` per document.
+ Defaults browsers apply when parts are missing.
+ Required elements vs optional components.

## Organization Principles

+ Semantic clarity: metadata in head, content in body.
+ Clean structure, indentation, and validation for compliance.
+ Document type declarations and their importance.
+ Proper nesting and containment rules.
