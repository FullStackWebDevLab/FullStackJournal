This information will be divided and placed in the appropriate phases in the roadmap.

---

* **Clients, servers, and internet architecture**
  Learn the difference between clients and servers, the role of ISPs, routers, and the internet backbone. Get familiar with the OSI model versus the TCP/IP model, and understand how data packets travel across networks. This helps you reason about latency, reliability, and performance.

* **DNS (Domain Name System)**
  Understand what DNS is, the roles of recursive resolvers and authoritative name servers, and how domain names are mapped to IP addresses. Learn about DNS caching, TTL (time to live), and record types like A, AAAA, CNAME, and MX. Study the step-by-step process of what happens when you type a domain name, including subdomains, top-level domains, and name servers.

* **URLs and URI components**
  Break down the parts of a URL: protocol, domain, path, query, and fragment. Learn the differences between HTTP and HTTPS, and how query parameters and path parameters work. Distinguish between URI, URL, and URN.

* **HTTP protocols, methods, and status codes**
  Learn the structure of requests and responses, including headers and body. Master common HTTP methods such as GET, POST, PUT, DELETE, and PATCH. Understand key status codes like 200, 301/302, 400, 401/403, 404, 500, and 503. Study HTTPS and TLS, including encryption, certificates, and the handshake process. Be aware of the differences between HTTP/1.1, HTTP/2, and HTTP/3.

* **Browser rendering process**
  Understand how a browser parses HTML to build the DOM, and CSS to build the CSSOM, then combines them into the render tree. Learn about layout, painting, and compositing. Study the difference between reflow and repaint, and how render-blocking resources affect performance. Explore concepts like the critical rendering path, event loop, and JavaScript execution. Compare static content, client-side rendering, server-side rendering, and static site generation.

* **Networking basics**
  Study TCP/IP fundamentals, including what packets are and how the TCP three-way handshake works. Learn about latency, bandwidth, and jitter, and how they affect user experience. Understand the TLS handshake, browser and DNS caching, and the role of CDNs in performance optimization.

* **Static vs dynamic sites, hosting, and deployment**
  Learn the difference between static and dynamic websites, and when each is appropriate. Explore hosting options like shared hosting, virtual machines, serverless, PaaS, and CDN hosting. Understand how domain registration, SSL/TLS setup, and DNS configuration fit into the picture. Learn how to deploy static pages, back-end code, and basic continuous integration workflows.

* **Web security basics**
  Grasp why HTTPS matters, and how certificates establish trust. Learn about common threats such as man-in-the-middle attacks, SQL injection, cross-site scripting (XSS), and cross-site request forgery (CSRF). Study input validation, sanitization, and the basics of CORS (Cross Origin Resource Sharing).
