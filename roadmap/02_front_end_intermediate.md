# Front-End Intermediate

* Fetching data from external sources (REST API) via JavaScript (e.g. `fetch`)
* More JavaScript: Promises, async/await
* Client-side form validation
* State management basics if the site grows
* Maybe learn a front-end framework/library (React, Vue, Angular) if you plan for richer UI.
