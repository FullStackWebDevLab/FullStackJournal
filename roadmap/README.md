# Full Stack Web Dev Roadmap

This roadmap takes you from zero knowledge to full stack web development, using Python for the backend. It begins with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript fundamentals, then advances to a front-end framework and backend development with Python, including APIs and databases. Along the way, it incorporates version control, deployment, and practical projects to ensure both conceptual understanding and hands-on proficiency in building complete web applications.

It is divided into 4 stages:

1. [Front-End Foundations](./01_front_end_foundations.md)
2. [Front-End Intermediate](./02_front_end_intermediate.md)
3. [Backend Python Foundations](./03_backend_python_foundations.md)
4. [Full-Stack Integration](./04_full_stack_integration.md)
