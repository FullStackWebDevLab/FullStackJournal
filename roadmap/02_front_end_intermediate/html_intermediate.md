# HTML Roadmap: Intermediate

This roadmap outlines advanced HTML concepts that extend beyond the foundational essentials. These topics are not required for building basic web pages, but they provide significant benefits in terms of accessibility, performance, scalability, and professional best practices. Learners are encouraged to approach this material after gaining confidence with the essentials and completing beginner projects. The purpose of this roadmap is to serve as a long-term guide for refining skills, improving the quality of real-world applications, and staying aligned with modern web standards.

### Responsive and Adaptive HTML practices

* Responsive images (`srcset`, `sizes`, `<picture>`)
* Correct attribute usage to avoid layout shifts (e.g. width/height on images)
* Consideration of mobile‚Äêfirst thinking: structuring content so it works well across device sizes

### HTML5 New / Modern Features

* Newer semantic / structural tags introduced in HTML5 (e.g. `<template>`, `<dialog>`, `<progress>`, `<meter>`)
* Multimedia enhancements: subtitles/captions, tracks in video/audio
* Embedding external content safely (`<iframe>`), sandboxing

### Internationalization / Localization

* Language (`lang`) attributes for sections of content
* Directionality (`dir="ltr"` / `rtl"`) where relevant
* Character encoding and use of Unicode

### Performance and Correctness in HTML

* Valid HTML: using validator tools; avoiding deprecated tags / attributes
* Minimizing unnecessary markup; clean, minimal nesting
* Understanding how HTML affects performance (e.g. how many HTTP requests, how large page becomes even before CSS/JS)
