Since CSS covers **theory, syntax, and application**, one universal format will quickly get messy.
So, here’s the smart breakdown:

* **Core concepts & theory-heavy sections** (e.g. “What is CSS”, “Box Model”) → **Concept Format**
* **Syntax / property-focused sections** (e.g. “Selectors”, “Typography”, “Flexbox”) → **Reference Format**
* **Practical / applied sections** (e.g. “Responsive Design”, “Performance”, “Projects”) → **Practical Format**

Let’s define these clearly 👇

---

## 🧠 Format 1: **Concept Format**

**Use for:**

* 1.1 What is CSS
* 1.4 The Box Model
* 4.1 Responsive Design Principles
* 6.1 CSS Architecture & Naming
* 7.4 Accessibility & CSS

**Purpose:** Capture *why* something matters, how it fits into the bigger picture, and key takeaways.

```markdown
# [Section Number] [Title]
(e.g. 1.1 What is CSS?)

## Overview
A short explanation of what this concept is and why it exists.

## Purpose
Why this topic matters in CSS and web development.

## Key Ideas
- [Idea 1]
- [Idea 2]
- [Idea 3]

## Visual Mental Model
Describe or sketch (if applicable) how the concept fits together.
*(e.g. for Box Model — draw content → padding → border → margin)*

## Real-World Relevance
Examples of where this shows up in real projects or design systems.

## Common Pitfalls / Misconceptions
- [Pitfall 1]
- [Pitfall 2]

## Quick Summary
A tight, 3–5 line recap of what to remember.
```

## 🧾 Format 2: **Reference Format**

**Use for:**
Most subsections — especially:

* 1.2 to 1.5
* 2.1 to 2.4
* 3.1 to 3.4
* 4.2, 4.3, 4.4
* 5.1 to 5.4
* 6.2, 6.3
* 7.1 to 7.3

**Purpose:** Serve as detailed notes for CSS syntax, properties, behaviors, and examples — like your personal MDN.

Would you like me to generate a **starter template folder structure** (like `/css-roadmap/1-fundamentals/1.1-what-is-css.md` prefilled with the right format skeletons)? It’d save you setup time and keep your note structure consistent across the roadmap.
