# [Title]
(e.g. Build Mini Projects; Sticky Header)

## Objective

Describe clearly what this exercise or project helps you achieve.

- What skill or habit does it build?  
- What specific problem does it train you to solve?  
- What is the practical outcome (a component, layout, effect, etc.)?

*(Example: Learn to use CSS positioning to keep navigation visible while scrolling.)*

You can also mention:
- **Difficulty level:** beginner / intermediate / advanced  
- **Prerequisites:** concepts or tools you should know first  

---

## Key Concepts

List the main CSS (and sometimes HTML/JS) concepts this exercise focuses on.

- [Concept 1]; short note on what you’ll practice  
- [Concept 2]; how it connects to the objective  
- [Tool or method]; frameworks, preprocessors, or dev tools involved  

*(Example: `position`, `z-index`, `sticky`, and layout flow.)*

---

## Example Implementation

Provide a clear, minimal working example that demonstrates the technique.

### HTML

```html
<header>Sticky Header</header>
<main>
  <p>Scroll to see effect...</p>
</main>
````

### CSS

```css
header {
  position: sticky;
  top: 0;
  background: white;
  border-bottom: 1px solid #ccc;
  padding: 1rem;
}
```

*(Optional: Add a note about variations, browser behavior, or responsive tweaks.)*

---

## Workflow

Break down the implementation process step by step.
Each step should be actionable and lead toward a working result.

1. **Set up the base structure**; HTML and basic layout.
2. **Apply core styles**; add relevant CSS rules for layout and behavior.
3. **Refine details**; adjust spacing, colors, or interactions.
4. **Test in context**; open in browser, scroll, resize, and debug.
5. **Document your findings**; note what worked and what didn’t.

*(Encourage small iterations; focus on learning, not perfection.)*

---

## Variations and Extensions

(Optional section)
After achieving the base implementation, explore variations.

* Modify it to work in a different context (e.g. sidebar instead of header).
* Add JavaScript interactivity or animation.
* Refactor for reusability in a larger project.
* Try a responsive version.

---

## Best Practices

Summarize the important lessons, optimization tips, and habits that make your implementation strong.

* Keep styles modular and reusable.
* Always test behavior across devices or screen sizes.
* Understand *why* something works before moving on.
* Comment or document logic for future reference.

*(Each practice should reinforce good developer habits.)*

---

## Common Pitfalls

List frequent mistakes and confusions that happen while doing the exercise.

* Forgetting to define `top`, `bottom`, `left`, or `right` for `position: sticky`.
* Overcomplicating CSS before testing basic functionality.
* Ignoring stacking context or `z-index` issues.

Explain briefly how to avoid each issue or how to debug it effectively.

---

## Real-World Example

Describe how or where this technique appears in production.

* A well-known site or app that uses it.
* A UI pattern it helps create.
* A framework or component inspired by this technique.

Include links if possible or screenshots/diagrams in your notes for visual reference.

---

## Reflection (Optional but Highly Valuable)

After completing the exercise, write a short reflection:

* What did you learn or discover?
* What was unexpectedly hard or confusing?
* What will you do differently next time?

> This section helps you **turn practice into understanding.**
