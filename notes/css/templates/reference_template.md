# [Title]
(e.g. Modern Layout; Flexbox)

---

## Overview

Explain what this feature or topic is, its main purpose, and where it fits into CSS.

- What problem does it solve?
- How does it differ from alternatives (e.g. Flexbox vs Grid)?
- When should you use it?

*(Example: Flexbox provides a one-dimensional layout system to align and distribute space among items in a container, ideal for rows or columns.)*

---

## Syntax

Provide the general syntax pattern and a short example.

```css
/* Example syntax */
selector {
  property: value;
}
```

You can also include multiple related declarations here if the feature involves several properties (e.g. transitions, animations, flexbox).

+ `property`: The CSS property used.
+ `value`: The accepted value(s) or keywords.

*(Include special syntaxes like shorthand or function-based values, e.g. `calc()`, `repeat()`, `var()`.)*

---

## Key Properties & Values

Break down all relevant properties and their main purpose.

+ `property-name`: What it controls. Example values.

Include explanations for shorthand forms and relationships between properties.
*(Example: `flex` is shorthand for `flex-grow`, `flex-shrink`, and `flex-basis`.)*

---

## Value Details and Parameters (if applicable)

If the feature supports functions, special keywords, or units, explain them.

* **Keyword**: Description of its meaning and when to use it.
* **Function syntax**: Show how to pass parameters.
* **Unit relevance**: When using `px`, `%`, `fr`, etc., explain what they mean in context.

*(Example: In `grid-template-columns: repeat(auto-fit, minmax(200px, 1fr))`, `repeat()` defines repeating patterns, and `auto-fit` dynamically fills available space.)*

## Examples

### Basic Example

Demonstrate the simplest valid use case.

```css
.container {
  display: flex;
}
```

### Advanced Example

Show a more realistic or complex implementation with commentary.

```css
.container {
  display: flex;
  justify-content: space-between;
  align-items: center;
  gap: 1rem;
}
```

Add HTML snippets alongside examples to visualize structure.

```html
<div class="container">
  <div>Item 1</div>
  <div>Item 2</div>
</div>
```
