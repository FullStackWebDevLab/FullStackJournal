## What is HTML and How It Works

HyperText Markup Language (HTML) is the foundational language of the World Wide Web. Its principal role is to **define the structure and semantics of digital documents**. HTML specifies *what* content exists (headings, paragraphs, lists, links, images, tables) while leaving *how* it is presented to Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) and *how* it behaves to JavaScript.

* **Structural Role**: HTML organizes content into a hierarchical document tree.
* **Semantic Role**: HTML elements convey meaning. For example, `<h1>` denotes a top-level heading, `<p>` denotes a paragraph, and `<nav>` denotes a navigation section.

It is important to emphasize that HTML does not control visual presentation or interactivity. Instead, it serves as the structural foundation upon which styling and scripting are layered.

## Markup Language vs. Programming Language

A frequent misconception is that HTML is a programming language. It is not. HTML belongs to the category of **markup languages**.

* **Markup Language**: A markup language uses annotations (tags) to describe the structure and meaning of content. It does not provide computational capabilities. Other examples include XML and Markdown.
* **Programming Language**: A programming language (such as JavaScript, Python, or C) provides control structures, variables, logic, and computational operations.

Thus, HTML is *declarative* rather than *procedural*: it declares the intended structure of a document but does not prescribe a sequence of operations.
