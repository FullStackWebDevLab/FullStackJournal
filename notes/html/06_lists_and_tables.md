# Lists and Tables

This tutorial covers the proper use of HTML lists and tables for presenting structured information. Using these elements semantically is crucial for accessibility, SEO, and content clarity.

## Unordered Lists (`<ul>`)

Unordered lists are used for collections of items where the sequence does not matter.

* **When to Use:** Choose `<ul>` for lists of related items without a specific order, such as features, ingredients, or navigation menu items.
* **Nesting and Indentation:** Lists can be nested to create hierarchies. Use proper indentation in your code to reflect the visual and semantic structure.
    ```html
    <ul>
      <li>Frontend
        <ul>
          <li>HTML</li>
          <li>CSS</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>Backend</li>
    </ul>
    ```
* **List Item Structure:** Each item must be wrapped in a `<li>` (list item) tag, which can contain other flow content, including paragraphs, images, or even other lists.
* **Accessibility:** Screen readers announce the number of items in a list, providing immediate context. Using semantic `<ul>` markup is far more accessible than using a series of manually styled `<div>` elements.

## Ordered Lists (`<ol>`)

Ordered lists are used for sequences where the order is important.

* **Numbering and Sequencing:** By default, items are numbered sequentially (1, 2, 3...). The `type` attribute can change the numbering style (e.g., `type="a"` for lowercase letters).
* **Start and Reversed:** Use the `start` attribute to begin counting from a number other than 1. The `reversed` attribute will display the count in descending order.
* **Custom Numbering:** For advanced styling (e.g., parentheses, colors), use the CSS `counter-increment` and `::marker` pseudo-element instead of non-semantic HTML.
* **Appropriate Use Cases:** Ideal for step-by-step instructions, rankings, or any content where the sequence conveys meaning.

## Definition Lists (`<dl>`)

Definition lists are for grouping terms with their corresponding descriptions or key-value pairs.

* **Key-Value Relationships:** The structure uses `<dt>` (definition term) for the key and `<dd>` (definition description) for the value.
    ```html
    <dl>
      <dt>HTML</dt>
      <dd>The standard markup language for creating web pages.</dd>
      <dt>CSS</dt>
      <dd>The language used for describing the presentation of a document.</dd>
    </dl>
    ```
* **Multiple Descriptions:** A single `<dt>` can be followed by multiple `<dd>` elements, which is useful for a term with several definitions or attributes.
* **Beyond Definitions:** While perfect for glossaries, `<dl>` is also semantically appropriate for metadata listings, FAQs, and any set of name-value pairs.

## Basic Table Structure (`<table>`)

Tables should be used exclusively for presenting tabular data.

* **Row-Based Thinking:** Construct tables row by row (`<tr>`), not column by column. Each row contains a set of cells.
* **Header vs. Data Cells:** Use `<th>` (table header) for cells that label a row or column. Use `<td>` (table data) for cells that contain the actual data.
* **Borders and Spacing:** All visual styling (borders, padding, spacing) should be handled with CSS, not HTML attributes like `border`.

## Advanced Table Semantics

For complex data sets, use additional elements to provide structural context.

* **Table Grouping:**
    * `<thead>`: Groups the header rows.
    * `<tbody>`: Groups the main body of data rows. A table can have multiple `<tbody>` sections to group data.
    * `<tfoot>`: Groups footer rows, often used for summaries.
* **Table Captions:** Use the `<caption>` element to provide a title or description for the entire table, which is highly beneficial for accessibility.
* **Multi-level Headers:** For tables with complex headers, use the `scope` attribute (`scope="col"` or `scope="row"`) and the `colspan`/`rowspan` attributes to define the scope of header cells.

## Table Accessibility

Accessibility is non-negotiable for data tables.

* **Screen Reader Navigation:** Properly structured tables allow screen reader users to understand the data's context and relationships.
* **Associating Headers with Data:** The `scope` attribute explicitly tells assistive technology whether a `<th>` is a header for a column, row, or group of columns/rows.
* **Complex Tables:** For tables with multiple layers of headers, use the `headers` attribute on `<td>` cells to explicitly list the `id`s of all relevant header cells. This is essential for complex data grids.

## List and Table Integration

Choosing the right element is a matter of semantics.

* **Lists vs. Tables:**
    * Use a **list** for a simple collection of items or a set of properties.
    * Use a **table** when you need to show a relationship between data points across two dimensions (e.g., comparing products by price, feature, and rating).
* **Nesting:** You can nest lists within table cells to present sub-items or multiple points within a single data cell.
* **Semantic Appropriateness:** Never use a table for general page layout. This is a deprecated practice that harms accessibility and responsiveness. Use CSS Flexbox or Grid for layout instead.

By applying these principles, you ensure that your structured content is semantically correct, accessible to all users, and easily maintainable.
