# Structuring Content in `<body>`

The `<body>` element contains all visible content of a web page. Its structure is paramount for usability, accessibility, and maintainability. This tutorial outlines the principles for organizing content logically and effectively.

## Document Outline and Hierarchy

A clear hierarchy is the foundation of a well-structured document. It creates a logical flow that both users and machines can understand.

* **Logical Heading Structure:** Use heading tags (`<h1>` to `<h6>`) to create a meaningful document outline. The `<h1>` should be the main title of the page, with subsequent headings nesting logically. Avoid skipping heading levels (e.g., going from `<h2>` to `<h4>`).
    *   **Good:** `H1` → `H2` → `H3` → `H2` → `H3`
    *   **Poor:** `H1` → `H3` → `H5` → `H2`

* **Section Nesting:** Use semantic sectioning elements like `<section>`, `<article>`, and `<aside>` to group related content. These elements help define the parent-child relationships and the scope of headings, creating a more explicit document structure.
* **Content Sequence:** Arrange content in a order that tells a coherent story or presents information from most general to most specific, guiding the user through the page naturally.

## Content Grouping and Organization

Grouping related items improves both semantics and styling.

* **When to Group:** Use elements like `<div>`, `<section>`, and `<article>` to group content that shares a common purpose or theme. For instance, a news website would wrap each story in an `<article>` element, grouping the headline, image, and text together.
* **Block vs. Inline:** Understand the difference:
    * **Block-level elements** (e.g., `<p>`, `<div>`, `<ul>`) form discrete blocks that typically stack vertically. Use them for major content sections.
    * **Inline elements** (e.g., `<a>`, `<strong>`, `<span>`) flow within a line of text. Use them to style or link pieces of content without disrupting the overall layout.
* **Semantic Coherence:** Ensure that each group has a single, clear purpose. A `<nav>` should contain only navigation, a `<footer>` should contain footer-related information, etc.

## Layout Structure

A consistent layout framework helps users orient themselves and find information quickly.

* **Major Content Sections:** Structure your page using landmark semantic elements:
    * `<header>`: For introductory content or navigational links for its nearest sectioning root.
    * `<main>`: For the dominant, unique content of the document. There should be only one per page.
    * `<footer>`: For information about its section, like copyright, links, or contact info.
    * `<nav>`: For a major block of navigation links.
* **Content Distribution:** Distribute content logically within these sections. The `<main>` area should hold the primary content the user is seeking, while supplementary information belongs in `<aside>` or `<footer>`.
* **Balance:** Use whitespace (margin and padding) effectively to separate content groups, reduce cognitive load, and create a visually pleasing, scannable layout.

## Accessibility and Navigation

Structure directly impacts accessibility. A well-built page is usable by everyone, including those relying on assistive technologies.

* **Logical Reading Order:** The order of elements in your HTML should match the visual and logical order of the page. Screen readers navigate content linearly from top to bottom.
* **Landmark Regions:** Semantic HTML5 elements (`<main>`, `<nav>`, `<aside>`, etc.) are automatically interpreted as ARIA landmark regions. This allows screen reader users to jump directly to major sections of the page, significantly improving navigation.
* **Text Alternatives:** Always provide descriptive text alternatives for non-text content using the `alt` attribute for images. This is essential for users who are visually impaired.

## Content Flow Principles

Guide the user's eye and attention through deliberate content organization.

* **Order of Importance:** Structure the flow of your page to present the most critical information first. This aligns with how users scan web pages.
* **Proximity and Separation:** Place related items close to each other (Law of Proximity) and separate unrelated groups. This visual cue helps users understand relationships and categories intuitively.
* **Scannable vs. Deep Content:**
    * For **scannable** content (e.g., news portals, product listings), use clear headings, short paragraphs, bulleted lists, and bold keywords.
    * For **deep** content (e.g., articles, tutorials), maintain a strong, linear narrative flow with clear sectional breaks to guide the user through the entire piece.

By applying these principles, you create a `<body>` that is not just visually arranged but is fundamentally sound, accessible, and provides an excellent experience for all users.
